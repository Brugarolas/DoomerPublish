## Usage
This project consists of the console application representing the tool and a template project that implements this tool. For more information on the template, navigate to the `README.md` located in the `template/` folder. To view the available commands supported by the tool, pass `--help` when invoking the tool, or invoke `publish-help.ps1` which is supplied with the template.

## Issues
None so far.

## Todo
- Ability to pack/unpack map files using `gdcc-ar-wad`.
- The ACS source folder should not be removed if there are stray ACS files inside it.
- See if it's possible to improve the log output that is generated from the tool.
- General todo items that can be found in the console application.
